//! Assembling the root config (SPEC.md §5): the root config is a property
//! of the OS process, merged from a file, flags and env into one object.
//!
//! The file's shape is [`drt_config::RootConfig`] — those serde types are
//! the source of truth, so this module carries no schema of its own, only
//! the reading and the startup checks. JSON is the format read today;
//! everything here is plain serde, so TOML or a `.dlua` surface is a
//! deserializer swap and not a schema change.
//!
//! **Grants are validated here, at startup, by name.** A capability whose
//! scope is malformed or ill-typed for the connector it names must fail
//! while the operator is still looking at the terminal — never as a
//! mystifying `denied` at first call.
